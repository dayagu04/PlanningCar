## Quick Stats (as of iter 20)
- Total iterations attempted: 20 (iter 07/09/10 reserved as planning slots, no runs)
- Accepted (merged to main): **8** — 00, 01, 02, 04, 05, 11, 14
- Rejected (kept as `failed/iter-NN-*` branches): **12** — 03, 06, 08, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20
- **Current best success rate**: 100% (adaptive_navigator, all terrains)
- **Current best path efficiency**: 0.229 (adaptive_navigator, averaged across terrains)
  - cumulative gain over iter 00 baseline (0.175): **+30.9%**
  - vs. iter 05 (last full TSP-tour baseline 0.211): **+8.5%**
- **time_to_goal**: 27.8 s (-3.1% vs iter 05)
- **replan_count**: 6.05 (stable)

## Key Lessons (iter 06–20)
1. **Classifier-replan coupling** — improving classification (iter 06) increases terrain transitions, which fragments paths via the `last_terrain != terrain` replan trigger. Classifier work needs synchronized replan-strategy adjustment.
2. **A\* cost-map architecture limit** — `update_cost_map(grid, terrain.value, None)` only accepts a single global terrain label, so per-cell terrain weighting (iter 08) has no effect. Real per-terrain cost shaping requires API-level changes (out of scope for parameter sweeps).
3. **Lookahead is highly sensitive** — `lookahead_base` and `lookahead_gain` are exquisitely tuned; +33% on either parameter (iter 15, 17) breaks the path-tracker. `max_lookahead` and `lookahead_min` had no observable effect (iter 16, 19), confirming `base+gain·v` is the binding term.
4. **DWA blend is fragile** — both stricter blending (iter 12 smoothness penalty) and looser blending (iter 18 graduated ramp) regress or break success on slope/rough. The current binary `0.4 if cc>0.5 else 0` switch is at a stable local optimum.
5. **Brake floor is co-tuned with iter 11 sigmoid** — relaxing the curvature brake floor (iter 20: 0.65→0.72) without retuning lookahead causes the wheel rate-limiter to dominate, blowing out time-to-goal.
